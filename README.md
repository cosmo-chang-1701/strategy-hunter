# Strategy Hunter

This is a full-stack application designed for analyzing and managing financial trading strategies. The project features a Python-based backend using FastAPI and a modern frontend built with React and Vite.

## Purpose of this Project

This project serves as a learning and experimental ground for exploring the collaborative capabilities of AI-powered coding assistants, specifically **GitHub Copilot** and **Google Jules**. The goal is to leverage these tools to accelerate development, improve code quality, and understand how they can work together in a real-world project scenario.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into two main parts:

- `backend/`: A FastAPI application that provides APIs for:

  - User Authentication
  - Trade Journaling
  - Market Data Retrieval
  - Options Chain Analysis
  - Volatility Calculation
  - Trading Strategy Management

- `frontend/`: A React single-page application (SPA) that provides the user interface for interacting with the backend services.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Python, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Pydantic
- **Frontend**: TypeScript, React, Vite
- **Database**: SQLite (for development)
